# AccuZone-Weather
## Description
The weather app that gives the user real-time current weather and five day weather forecast by searching for the name of the city.



The goal for the project was to create an app which the users can generate their own secure password by chosing criteria given (Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers and Special characters) as well as th length of the password of their choice. When 'Generate Password' button is clicked, the whole process begins. If invalid user input accurs (Any numbers NOT within the range of 8 and 128) the result will return 'undefined'. Also it has a function to copy the password to the user's clipboard.
